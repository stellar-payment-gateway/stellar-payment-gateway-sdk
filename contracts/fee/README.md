# `fee`

> Fee collection, escrow, tiered pricing, and cycle-based release management for Stellar Payment Gateway SDK.

## Overview

The `fee` contract manages the complete lifecycle of transaction fees within Stellar Payment Gateway SDK. Fees are collected into an escrow balance, grouped by billing cycles, and released to a treasury address on demand. The contract supports fee decay (reduced fees for active users), user tier assignment, configurable basis-point rates with min/max bounds, and a lock mechanism to freeze configuration changes.

## Features

- **Basis-Point Fee Calculation**: Configurable fee rate in BPS (default: 500 = 5%)
- **Fee Decay**: Active users pay lower fees based on their last activity timestamp
- **Escrow Model**: Collected fees are held in escrow until explicitly released per cycle
- **Cycle Management**: Fees are grouped into cycles; admins release or roll over per cycle
- **User Tiers**: Assign bronze/silver/gold/platinum tiers for tiered pricing
- **Min/Max Fee Bounds**: Enforce floor and ceiling on individual fee amounts
- **Batch Collection**: Collect fees for multiple amounts in a single call
- **Lock/Unlock**: Admin can lock the contract to prevent configuration changes
- **Reconciliation**: Compare stored vs. calculated balances for integrity checks
- **Consolidated Storage**: Config and stats use single-struct reads for gas efficiency

## Public API

### Initialization

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, token: Address, treasury: Address, fee_bps: u32, initial_cycle: u64)
pub fn init(env: Env, admin: Address, token: Address, treasury: Address)
```

`initialize` sets up the contract with custom fee BPS and initial cycle. `init` is a convenience wrapper using defaults (300 BPS, cycle 1).

---

### Fee Collection

#### `collect_fee`

```rust
pub fn collect_fee(env: Env, payer: Address, amount: i128) -> i128
```

Collects a fee from `payer` on `amount`, applying fee decay based on user activity. Returns the updated pending fee balance.

#### `collect_fee_batch`

```rust
pub fn collect_fee_batch(env: Env, payer: Address, amounts: Vec<i128>) -> BatchFeeResult
```

Batch-collects fees for multiple amounts. Max batch size: 100.

#### `preview_batch_fee`

```rust
pub fn preview_batch_fee(env: Env, _payer: Address, amounts: Vec<i128>) -> i128
```

Dry-run fee calculation without state changes.

---

### Fee Release & Rollover

#### `release_fees`

```rust
pub fn release_fees(env: Env, admin: Address, cycle: u64) -> i128
```

Admin-only. Releases all pending fees for a given cycle to the treasury.

#### `rollover_fees`

```rust
pub fn rollover_fees(env: Env, admin: Address, next_cycle: u64) -> i128
```

Admin-only. Rolls pending fees from the current cycle into `next_cycle`.

### Configuration

| Function              | Auth  | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `set_fee_bps(bps)`    | Admin | Update fee rate in basis points               |
| `set_treasury(addr)`  | Admin | Update treasury address                       |
| `set_min_fee(amount)` | Admin | Set minimum fee floor                         |

| `reset_fee_config()`  | Admin | Reset to defaults (500 BPS, min_fee = 0)      |
| `lock()`              | Admin | Lock contract — prevents config changes       |
| `unlock()`            | Admin | Unlock contract — re-enables config changes   |

All configuration functions require the contract to be unlocked.

---

### User Tiers

```rust
pub fn set_user_tier(env: Env, admin: Address, user: Address, tier: Symbol)
pub fn get_user_tier(env: Env, user: Address) -> Option<Symbol>
pub fn remove_user_tier(env: Env, admin: Address, user: Address)
```

Valid tiers: `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, `platinum`.

## Storage Layout

### Instance Storage (Consolidated)

| DataKey Variant | Value Type  | Description                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FeeConfig`     | `FeeConfig` | Admin, token, treasury, fee_bps, min/max fee, is_locked, cycle   |
| `FeeStats`      | `FeeStats`  | Escrow balance, total collected, total released, batch call count |

### Persistent Storage

| DataKey Variant          | Value Type | Description                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `PendingFees(u64)`       | `i128`     | Pending fee amount per cycle        |
| `UserActivity(Address)`  | `u64`      | Last activity timestamp per user    |
| `UserTier(Address)`      | `Symbol`   | Fee tier per user                   |

> **Storage Optimization (#484):** Config and stats are stored as consolidated structs (`FeeConfig`, `FeeStats`) instead of individual keys, reducing instance-storage reads from 12 to 2.

## Usage Example

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{Env, Address, Vec};
use fee::FeeContract;

// 1. Initialize with defaults
contract.init(&env, &admin, &token, &treasury);

// 2. Collect a fee
let pending = contract.collect_fee(&env, &payer, 10_000_000);

// 3. Batch collect
let result = contract.collect_fee_batch(
    &env,
    &payer,
    &vec![&env, 5_000_000, 3_000_000],
);

// 4. Release fees for cycle 1
let released = contract.release_fees(&env, &admin, 1);

// 5. Check reconciliation
let status = contract.get_reconciliation_status(&env);
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -p fee
```

## Design Notes

- **Storage Optimization (#484)**: The `FeeConfig` and `FeeStats` structs consolidate what were previously 12+ separate instance-storage keys into 2 struct reads. This significantly reduces Soroban I/O overhead and rent costs.
- **Fee Decay**: The `calculate_fee_decay` function reduces fees for users who have been recently active, incentivising platform engagement.
- **Lock/Unlock pattern**: When locked, no configuration can change. This enables "freeze periods" during audits or before cycle releases.
- **Reconciliation**: The `reconcile` function independently computes what the escrow balance should be from collected/released totals and compares it to the stored value, providing a safety net against state drift.
