# `savings-goals`

> Batch savings goal creation, milestone tracking, contributions, withdrawals, and goal cloning on Stellar.

## Overview

The `savings-goals` contract is Stellar Payment Gateway SDK's savings management system. It allows admins to create savings goals for multiple users in a single batch call, and users to contribute toward their goals, track milestones at 25/50/75/100%, withdraw funds (with optional lock periods and early-withdrawal penalties), clone existing goals, and reverse recent contributions. The contract is designed for high-throughput batch operations with O(n) processing, partial failure support, and minimized storage writes.

## Features

- **Batch Goal Creation**: Create savings goals for up to 100 users in one call
- **Batch Milestones**: Mark milestone achievements for multiple goals at once
- **Contributions**: Users contribute toward goals with automatic milestone emission
- **Contribution Reversal**: Reverse contributions within a 24-hour window
- **Withdrawals**: Withdraw funds with lock period enforcement and early-withdrawal penalties
- **Goal Cloning**: Clone an existing goal with inherited settings and a fresh balance
- **Goal Renaming**: Rename an active goal (unique per user)
- **Progress Tracking**: Query progress percentage, snapshots, and prerequisites
- **Prerequisite Goals**: Goals can depend on other goals being completed first
- **Expiration**: Goals can expire after a configured duration
- **Partial Failure**: Batch operations continue past individual failures

## Public API

### Initialization

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address)
```

Sets the admin, initializes `LastBatchId`, `LastGoalId`, `TotalGoalsCreated`, and `TotalBatchesProcessed` to zero.

---

### Batch Operations

#### `batch_set_savings_goals`

```rust
pub fn batch_set_savings_goals(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,                    // Admin only
    requests: Vec<SavingsGoalRequest>,
) -> BatchGoalResult
```

Creates goals for multiple users. Each request specifies target amount, deadline, initial contribution, priority, lock duration, penalty BPS, and expiration. Returns `BatchGoalResult` with per-goal success/failure details and aggregate metrics.

#### `batch_mark_milestones`

```rust
pub fn batch_mark_milestones(
    env: Env,
    caller: Address,                          // Goal owner
    requests: Vec<MilestoneAchievementRequest>,
) -> BatchMilestoneResult
```

Marks milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) for multiple goals. Only the goal owner can mark milestones. Validates progress percentage before marking.

---

### Individual Operations

#### `contribute_to_goal`

```rust
pub fn contribute_to_goal(env: Env, caller: Address, goal_id: u64, amount: i128) -> u64
```

Contributes funds to a goal. Enforces prerequisite completion, expiration, and caps at target amount. Returns a `contrib_id` for reversal. Emits milestone events at 25/50/75/100%.

#### `reverse_contribution`

```rust
pub fn reverse_contribution(env: Env, caller: Address, goal_id: u64, contrib_id: u64) -> i128
```

Reverses a contribution within `REVERSAL_PERIOD_SECS` (24 hours). Returns the updated goal balance.

#### `withdraw_from_goal`

```rust
pub fn withdraw_from_goal(env: Env, caller: Address, goal_id: u64, amount: i128) -> i128
```

Withdraws funds from a goal. Blocked if goal is locked (before `unlock_at`). Applies early-withdrawal penalty if `penalty_bps > 0`.

#### `clone_savings_goal`

```rust
pub fn clone_savings_goal(env: Env, caller: Address, goal_id: u64, new_goal_name: Symbol) -> u64
```

Clones a goal with the same target, deadline, priority, lock/expiration durations, and penalty — but with a zero balance and new name.

## Usage Example

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{Env, Address, Symbol, Vec};
use savings_goals::{SavingsGoalsContract, SavingsGoalRequest};

// 1. Initialize
contract.initialize(&env, &admin);

// 2. Batch create goals
let result = contract.batch_set_savings_goals(&env, &admin, &vec![
    &env,
    SavingsGoalRequest {
        user: user_a.clone(),
        goal_name: Symbol::new(&env, "vacation"),
        target_amount: 50_000_000_000,  // 5000 XLM
        deadline: 1_000_000,
        initial_contribution: 1_000_000_000,
        priority: 1,
        lock_duration_seconds: 0,
        penalty_bps: 0,
        expiration_seconds: 0,
    },
]);
assert_eq!(result.successful, 1);

// 3. Contribute
let contrib_id = contract.contribute_to_goal(&env, &user_a, 1, 5_000_000_000);

// 4. Check progress
let progress = contract.get_goal_progress(&env, 1);
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -p savings-goals
```

---

## Design Notes

- **Single-pass O(n) batch processing**: Each batch request is processed in a single loop to minimize compute overhead.
- **Contribution capping**: Contributions are capped at the remaining amount to reach the target, preventing over-accumulation.
- **Reversal window**: The `REVERSAL_PERIOD_SECS` (24h) allows users to undo accidental contributions. After the window, contributions are permanent.
- **Prerequisite graph**: Goals can declare prerequisites via `GoalPrereqs`. Contributions are blocked until all prerequisites are marked complete. This enables sequential savings workflows (e.g., "emergency fund before vacation fund").
- **Name uniqueness**: `GoalByName(Address, Symbol)` enforces that a user cannot have two goals with the same name.
- **`PERSISTENT_TTL_BUMP`**: Goal records get a ~146-day TTL bump on access, balancing storage rent costs against goal lifecycle duration.
